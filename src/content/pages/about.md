# NootSponge Lore

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/ren-headshot-transparent.png" width="25%" height="25%" />

Hello, I'm [NootSponge](/why-nootsponge) but you can call me Ren. I'm a [fluffy purple dragon](/oc) on the internet. I'm a college student working torwards a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a minor in Communication Management.

## I like to play video games

But, I'm not very good at them. You'll find that I enjoy playing solo story games or social games like <a href="https://neos.com" target="_blank">Neos</a>. Here's a non-exhaustive list of my favorite games in no specific order.

- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250" target="_blank">Neos</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140" target="_blank">SOMA</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/470260" target="_blank">Event[0]</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620" target="_blank">Portal 2</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820" target="_blank">Starbound</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490" target="_blank">Prey</a>
- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560" target="_blank">Half Life: Alyx</a>

You'll notice that I have a fondness for story-rich games and particularly ones that involve space or sci-fi (SOMA, Event[0], Starbound, Prey). Please feel free to hit me up if you have any suggestions! My DMs are always open as long as you aren't a bot! ;3

## Software Engineer? You must be a nerd

Correct. <3

I brand myself as a "Software Engineer" but really that's my dream job. I like playing with different web technologies and experimenting with different languages. Most recently I've been playing with <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby (on Rails)</a> and <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a> (I'm writing this in Astro right now!!).

I also have a mission to containerize everything or utilize free services like <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Pages</a> (a free Jamstack platform). Ever since being introduced to <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> I've built most all of my applications in images to be run on the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/" target="_blank">OCI platform</a> (Docker, Podman, k8s). I'm absolutely in love with the OCI and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>, although messing with k8s is a bit difficult as a non-megacorporation.

Similarly with games, if you think I might be interested in a technology please feel free to hmu! I wouldn't have found out about Astro if it weren't for a friend of mine telling me about it!

## Ew, you're a _furry_

Mhm. :3

I'm a weird tech-interested furry whose home is the internet. If you wanna know more about my sona then you can check out this entire page on it [here](/oc). But otherwise, yes I'm a furry if you didn't know and I'm sorry if it's a shock but I have been for many many years in the closet. But I finally decided that I'm tired of hiding it, I'm still the same Andrew/NootSponge/Ren that you knew before, I just openly associate myself with a group of furry characters, what's so bad about that?
