# My Original Character

<img style="float: right;" src="/img/ren-front.png" width="20%" height="20%" />

Meet Ren! He is a fluffy purple dragon (<a href="https://nardoiri.gumroad.com/l/Nardoragon" target="_blank">Nardoiri's style</a>) with yellow skin and golden yellow horns (serving as his crown ;3).

## Crown?

Yep, Ren's a king! A king of what, you might ask? He's the king of _you_~

## Gooey?

Something I've yet to mention is that Ren is actually a goo creature! He just chooses to portray himself as a purple dragon, however he can at his discretion choose to take the form of any creature he wants.

The color of his body is actually yellow, and that's the color of the organism himself, a yellow liquid goo monster!

## Lore?

Lore in pogress.
