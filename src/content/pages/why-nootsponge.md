# Why NootSponge?

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1.5em;" title="ignore the fucking ifunny thing" src="/img/high-noot.jpg" width="25%" height="25%" />

Although I've used many usernames over the years, I finally settled on NootSponge after coming up with it with a friend ALLLLL the way back in middle school.

Originally it was "NootSpongeborb," a combination of the meme "it's high noot," which is an image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingu" target="_blank">Pingu</a> with <a href="https://overwatch-archive.fandom.com/wiki/McCree" target="_blank">McCree</a>'s outfit from Overwatch, and "Spongebob..." but not... like I said, it came from middle school so take that as you will...

I just shortened it to NootSponge which is basically never taken on websites for the username.

I think that's it tbh.
