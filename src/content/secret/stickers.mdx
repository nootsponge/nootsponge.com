### 3. Butt squish

Smiling same as ^, no YCH just squishing butt against "glass," make sure im HELLA thicc and lots of tail+cheek squish. Please make sure the "Y" or "triangular" butt shape is a thing (basically the anus is the combination of both cheeks and the tail like in the second reference).
